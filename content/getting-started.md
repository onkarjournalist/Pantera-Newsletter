Here are basic instructions to help you get started writing.

**General Writing Guidelines**

Deadlines, unless otherwise specified, are same day or next day, as soon as possible.  Please upload rough drafts in plain text form as the next comment in the issue as soon as possible, and as soon as you have finished them.  Do not save your drafts and only upload the final version.  We want to see all drafts and rewrites in real time as you complete them.

Please note low word counts of the example content types: newsletters, video texts, profile texts, etc.  Each follow a slightly different format and length.  If example texts are not given in the relevant issue, then check the website. 

For example, in the case of the newsletters, we'd like you to deliver short and sweet and as quickly as possible.

We encourage you to submit rough drafts, outlines and any questions you might have in order to get quick feedback and help you save time.

Quick turnaround and writing quality are always the top priorities.  Getting a high word count is less important in most cases.  Readable text always has to be delivered on time. 

In terms of readability, please check the website to get a rough idea of the tone and voice we need.


**Setup Website Account**

Setup has four steps:

1. Go to https://www.bitcoinwednesday.com/wp-admin/

2. Before you see the Wordpress login, you will be prompted by the webserver for a user name and password.

For the user name type: polaris
For the password type the password I sent you by mail.

The webserver prompt looks something like this:

When you have done the first two steps correctly you will see the Wordpress admin login at 

https://www.bitcoinwednesday.com/wp-admin/

Please let generalseven know whether you have succeeded with these first two steps.

https://www.bitcoinwednesday.com/wp-admin/ looks like this:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1835347/60413449-45a08d80-9bd5-11e9-9e3c-73c4d697058d.png)

3. Register on https://www.bitcoinwednesday.com/wp-admin/

Let generalseven know what user name and E-mail address you used to register.

For safety use strong passwords with at least 35 characters and in this format: https://passwordsgenerator.net/

4. Create a test page.  Click on `Videos` in the lefthand menu and create a new video page.

Done?  Let @generalseven know so we can check.  Still need more help?  Then read the next section on `Creating Posts in Wordpress` below.

### Video SEO Guide for Google - for better video rankings of YouTube video on Google search. 

- [ ] Step 1 - Use Google AdWords Keyword Planner to find keywords for the information you are going to use for video optimization. Only use low competition, long tail keywords.

For example - If your video is about 'Bitcoin exchange', 'Bitcoin exchange rate' could be a good keyword as you can see it has low competition and is a longtail keyword with 3 words.

![keyword planner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30005700/29743209-3084dc78-8aaa-11e7-9ed2-5c9005622c27.jpg)
  
- [ ] Step 2 - Try to base the YouTube video title on one of the below listed or similar queries from Google. This is recommended because users generally search in these formats.

- [keyword] video
- How to [keyword]
- [keyword] tutorial
- What is [keyword]

For example - If your video is keyword is 'Trading Bitcoin', your YouTube video title could be:
"Bitcoin trading video" OR "How to trade Bitcoin" OR "Bitcoin Trading Tutorial" 

- [ ] Step 3  Optimize the raw video file before uploading it. 

Unlike YouTube, apart from usual SEO applied to the video's webpage, Search engines look for the raw file information. So, attach title, tags and description to the raw video file. To do that 'Right click' on the video file and select 'Properties' if you are using windows or click 'Get info' if you are using MacBook.

![files info fill](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30005700/29742948-c9597422-8aa5-11e7-9e44-a47f2f6422f0.jpg)

* In the description, use keywords that you found via Google AdWords Keyword Planner. Also, the description should be 50-100 words long. 

- [ ] Step 4 - In your YouTube video, insert as many relevant links to the website like post link, home page link, event link, speaker profile link etc. This way you can build links and make your video seem more credible to Google. In addition, another way of linking your video is by posting the link via email newsletters, on forums and communities.  



**Videos: Text for Website and YT**

- [ ] Please note format used for our most recently published videos.

- [ ] We need titles, tags and descriptions for YT. 

- [ ] We need title, subtitle, content with YT embed text for the relevant video and snippet text.

- [ ] Also, in Wordpress the link should be edited to this format: 

> https://www.bitcoinwednesday.com/videos/firstname-lastname-jobtitle-company/

- [ ] For titles, avoid dry, declarative sentences if possible.  Better titles can spark users curiosity. For, instance, many videos on TEDTalks (https://www.youtube.com/user/TEDtalksDirector) are starting with a "5W "sentences (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) which is asking a question to the audience, then in order to find answer, people will have to watch the video to find out.

**Acceptable Writing**

Readability and writing quality are at least as important as your daily word count.  See Elements of Style at https://github.com/SBTCN/tigerhill2/blob/master/content/strunk-white-the-elements-of-style-4th-edition.pdf for a guideline on what is considered acceptable writing.  BitcoinWednesday.com should also give you a better idea.  

**Content Types**

* Speaker Profiles

Introduces the speaker, organization, subject of the presentation and date of the presentation.  Then usually adds necessary background about the organization, presentation subject, and speaker, followed by a bio of the speaker.  The speaker submits some background info which usually needs to be supplemented by other sources, especially Linkedin and the organization's website.

All links to be used on the website will follow this format:

<a href="https://www.bitcoinwednesday.com/events/bitcoin-wednesday-80/">5 February, 2020</a> when it's an internal link to a page on our own website.

<a href="https://slock.it/" rel="nofollow" >Slockit</a> when  its a link to another website
