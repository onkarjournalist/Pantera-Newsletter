**Estimating Points**

_This section is required reading only if you have been asked to estimate points using Scrum, instead of % of a task completed, hours or some other metric._

Before starting any work, we always estimate points and a delivery date for each open issue.  In doing so we are using many aspects of a project management methodology known as _Scrum_.

This document provides step-by-step instructions on how this process works.  Please read and review it carefully, and make a note of any questions you have.

_After reading the instructions once, many people find it useful to review these instructions again after they have actually started estimating._

a. Points should follow the Fibonacci series starting with 2, so 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on...

b. Before starting to work you should estimate as many issues as possible and as many as make sense to you.

c. If an issue does not make sense to you, ask specific questions in the relevant issue to help clarify it until you understand what needs to be done. 

d. When you have completed your initial estimates, you can e-mail them to richard@BitcoinWednesday.com for initial review in a simple format something like the following:


 issue # | # points | delivery date
  -- | -- | -- |
 1 | 3 | 05 Jan 18
 2 | 5 | 05 Jan 18
 4 | 2 | 29 Jan 18
 6 | 8 | 01 Feb 18

e. To estimate you determine the relative size of the task.

What does "relative size" mean in this context?  To get the quickest, most accurate estimates, we use comparison rather than measurement. Often you may not know in advance exactly what a task will require, but you can compare its scale to that of a similar task. Think of two stones â€” you can see which one is larger much faster than you can measure them.

f. Use the Fibonnaci series as a measuring scale: Estimate the size of a task using this point scale: 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 and so on...

The smallest task you can imagine gets 2 points. (You always get 1 point for free.)  A task that requires 50% more work than a 2-point issue gets 3 points. A task that requires 400% more work than a 2-point issue gets 8 points.

g. Apply this scale consistently. If a task requires more than 13 points, at some point it should be split into smaller tasks and these smaller tasks should be estimated.

h. Please use plain text.

To send initial estimates by email, this simple format is fine:

issue # -- # of points -- delivery date

3 -- 3 -- 18.01

4 -- 3 -- 18.01

5 -- 5 -- 18.01
