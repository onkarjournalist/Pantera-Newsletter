**Welcome On Board**

Welcome to Bitcoin Wednesday.  Here are the steps to get started.


**I. Create A Bitcoin Wallet**

a. Bitcoin Wednesday uses Bitcoin for payments. Therefore it is essential for you to install a Bitcoin wallet if you have not done so.

b. There are many excellent options.  We recommend Edge for I-phone or Android.  We do not recommend you install a wallet on the Windows Operating System.

c. Caution: It is critical to keep your password safe.

d. Please send your public bitcoin address and phone number to richard@bitcoinwednesday.com

> A Bitcoin address, or simply address, is an identifier of 26-35 alphanumeric characters, beginning with the number 1, 3 or bc1 that represents a possible destination for a bitcoin payment.

> To find your public address in the Edge wallet, sign in and click "Request" at the bottom, then you can see "Your Receiving Wallet Address" with the alphanumeric characters.


**II. Create A GitHub Account**

a. Bitcoin Wednesday uses GitHub as a way for project management.  Your tasks will be assigned, discussed and tracked here.

b. Go to GitHub.com and create an account if you have not done so.

c. Send your username to richard@bitcoinwednesday.com


**III. E-mail Your Legal Address and a Copy of Your Passport** 


**IV. Wait for a Github Invitation**

We will invite you to one of the project work spaces via Github once we have received your
information.  A workspace in Github is called a repository or repo for short.  It is where tasks are specified and assigned and where work is documented every day.


**V. How to Use GitHub**

a After you have received a link to your first workspace, you should be able to see a README message which directs you to your issues page where tasks are specified and assigned.

b. The screenshot below is an example of an issues page which shows a list of open issues.  You can see the issues are all titled  according to the subject of the issue with a label for priority (High, Medium, Low and Urgent).  Urgent means that a task should be completed right away, if not immediately.  High means that a task should be completed before anything marked Medium or Low.  There are also other labels that give additional information.

![issues](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1835347/71701841-57552e80-2dcc-11ea-96a7-dd39292c86c8.png)

Our workspaces should all have many of these same labels and colors although there may sometimes be some slight variations.

c. Aside from the priority labels, issues are scheduled to be completed during a period of time (called a `Milestone` in Github, but we also refer to them as a `Sprint`).

To create a milestone you should have one for each event tagged with the right DUE DATE.

BTC1W#74 - 7 August 2019
BTC1W#75 - 4 September 2019
BTC1W#76 - 2 October 2019

and so on up to and including 1 January of the following year.

eg.

When milestones have been created correctly, they should look something like this:

d. Issues are assigned to individuals whose responsibility it is to handle them.  For example, to create a new task and assign it to someone select `New Issue` give it a title and a description, then assign it to a specific person.  When you have completed your work on an issue, you state what you have done and then reassign the issue to the next person who needs to work on it.  As a general rule, do not close an issue yourself.  Instead, you write something like `@generalseven I've completed this, please close the issue`.  Then reassign the issue to @generalseven.

e. To quickly learn how to navigate the GitHub work space, please watch this short video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kezinXSoV5A

After watching this video once, many people find it useful to review the video again after they have actually gotten started using it.

**VI. Track Your Performance**

a. You will have an issue assigned to you to track your performance.  Performance tracking must be done every day you work.

b. Your compensation is based on the work you accomplished successfully and the delivery date.  We will eventually assign points to what you have done, and track the points, not the hours you spend.  (If you are just getting started, in unusual cases it may be okay to use % completed or hours spent if it has been agreed in advance.)  Please use the following format to track your performance.

_Template Text_

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1835347/63219333-e4764e80-c16f-11e9-99b0-e0e8b2ef8a30.png)

If you add the template text you see above to a reply in the issue, it will automatically generate a nicely formatted table similar to what you see below.  NOTE: Please use `complete` and `in progress`, not `open` and `closed` as shown below:

# points done today 	# still to do 	delivery date

 issue # | status | # points done today | # points still to do | delivery date
 -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
 1 | complete | 3 | 0 | 05 Jan 18
 2 | complete | 5 | 0 | 05 Jan 18
 4 | in progress | 2 | 2 | 29 Jan 18
 6 | in progress | 8 | 3 | 01 Feb 18

c. Create a new table every day to show your progress each day.  Your performance -- and your compensation -- is directly related to how well you complete these daily tables.

d. Aim to achieve at least 1% improvement in performance for every milestone.  Avoid a performance level that remains the same or declines over time.  We expect to see some progress daily.

e. Register leave of absences in your performance tracking issue _as far in advance as possible_ -- never after the fact.  Failing to do so may effect your compensation.
