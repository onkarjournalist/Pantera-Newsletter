Welcome to this workspace.

If you're new here, these are some simple guidlines to help you get started quickly.

Tasks are specified and assigned via https://github.com/SBTCN/tigerhill4/issues with HIGH, MEDIUM and LOW priorities. If something is marked urgent, it needs to be handled right away.

The first sprint is https://github.com/SBTCN/tigerhill4/milestone/1

Questions about an issue can be asked by adding a reply at the end of an issue. When you have completed the task, add a reply with the word DONE! and then reassign it to the person who should handle it next.

When an issue is ready to close, add a reply like @generalseven ready to close? so that @generalseven can close it.

For more detailled information, please see  https://github.com/SBTCN/tigerhill4/blob/master/WELCOME.md
